The Arch Build System, or ABS, is a series of tools used to obtain the PKGBUILD
scripts that make the packages in Arch Linux's official repositories and work
with them.

Included with ABS is a collection of prototype PKGBUILD files which are
installed to /usr/share/pacman for building special types of packages, such as
modules for various programming languages. These are installed alongside the
stock PKGBUILD and .install file prototypes provided by pacman.
