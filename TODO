makeworld:
* Remove dependency to only build categories
* Somehow parse options once for correctness (and not copy paste from makepkg)
* tee build output to screen and to log file (or use makepkg's built in logging)
* add signal/trap functionality (so C^c actually kills the whole thing and not
  a single call to makepkg)
