abs:
* support multiple arches, or find a way to roll 'any' into current arch

makeworld:
* Use a separate build dir (other than /var/abs/$repo/$pkg) so that this can
  realistically be used as a non-root user
* Somehow parse options once for correctness (and not copy paste from makepkg)
* tee build output to screen and to log file (or use makepkg's built in logging)
